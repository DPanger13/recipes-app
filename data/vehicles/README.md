This module is a simple wrapper for the multi-platform lib so data layer modules can import a
library like any other external or third-party dependencies. It is not to be used directly or
outside of the data layer. Ideally, this would be in a separate project that's responsible for
creating artifacts that can be imported via Maven or similar.
